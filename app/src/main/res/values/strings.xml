           The IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a globally unique number to identify any SIM based mobile device. You can view the mobile phone\'s IMEI by pressing *#06# on dialpad of the device. If the device has two simcards, you will see two 14-16 digit codes. Enter the 14-16 digit IMEI number in the box and click on the &quot;check&quot; box to view its detail.

           Device Characterization Platform (DCP) is a platform for authorized users to categorize devices based on their IMEI by querying GSMA IMEI database. It fetches information associated with an IMEI from the database and displays to user. It gives option to user to report counterfeit device if its TAC part of IMEI is not approved by GSMA or characteristics retrieved from the database does not match with the physical device.
